* When I open the command line and run the node index I am then prompted with a series of questions.
* These questions that you follow through will lead to the development of your readme.
* It will ask you to input a title description, installation, usage, contribution, test, and contact info.
* After all that is done it will spit out a generated read-me that you are able to use when you want
